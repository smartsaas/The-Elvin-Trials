# The-Elvin-Trials
A small repository with various tests for Elvin on the hooks discussed.

React Hooks discussed: useState, useCallback, useEffect.

Additional libraries on learning schedule (this list will grow): Axios, react-query (useQuery)

LESSON 1: Basic Hooks Intro with Axios and useQuery


Synopsis: 
The idea is to learn through practical usage, implementation of hooks within a full-stack context. We will emit back-end for now and focus on front-end. We want to use these tasks to understand your grasp of basic React principles as well as OOP. 

To help with the learning, I have created a small project on CodeSandBox that uses react-native and changes can be immediately viewed. I am not too sure with your familiarity in setting-up the project on your local PC/Mac so we can discuss that the next time we meet. 


*/  this project will be written in React-Native with TypeScript using Expo as a compiler and viewed on the browser (i.e. Expo Web). */

Resources: 
Random API: https://random-data-api.com/documentation
Axios: https://axios-http.com/


Task 1:
Query Random Api with useQuery to retrieve a JSON object to display on screen.
 If you would like, you can combine this in one component or spread over many. Either way, let me know if you need help. 

//TODO import the appropriate modules required to contain and view the components at the top-level, for example:  import { View } from ‘react-native’;
//TODO create a fetch function with Axios using the api connection above
//TODO initialise a variable with useState hook
//TODO call the fetch function to import random data with the random API using useQuery
//TODO fetch and import data with a useEffect on dependency of useState
//TODO return a View of Text items of the data that you fetched
